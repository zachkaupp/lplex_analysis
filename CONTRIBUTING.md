### to add new features:
- create another script file, numbered by when you think it should be run in the order of the scripts

### general conventions:
- only take external input (other than `readline`) in the dataclean file, and all other files should use the variables created by dataclean
- initialize anything configurable or manual as a variable in the settings file, except for things that should every need to be changed (like the `save_plot` variables). In that case, put them at the top of the file.
- packages need to be imported in the `packages` file
- code needs to be adequately commented
