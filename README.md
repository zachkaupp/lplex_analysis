#### TODO

-   heatmaps
-   finish pca clustering
-   flag some outliers? (on hold?)
-   put raw data stuff on hold
-   put table 1 stuff on hold (santiago)
-   figure out why greek letters won't export in csv (don't try .xlsx again, that was a nightmare) (if you do make sure to branch, and don't commit to main) (fix ifn gamma)
-   find a way to visual just one value (e.g. NIL) for when they want that
